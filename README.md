# hashcash

This repo implements [hashcash](https://hashcash.org) in Go. A few
simple primitives like `Mint` and `Valid` functions are exposed out of
this module. There are some tests that use the property-based testing
library. However they are not very exhaustive yet.

To use the library, simply import the library from the git repository.
